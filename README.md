![CLOUD HONEYNET SOC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/164ff7e8-dc7e-4a01-852b-047315891709)

## Overview

In this project, I deployed a mini honeynet in Azure, aggregating log data from various resources into a Log Analytics workspace. The data was then leveraged by Microsoft Sentinel to construct attack vectors, generate real-time alerts, and create security incidents. Initially, I monitored security telemetry in the vulnerable environment for 24 hours, then implemented a series of hardening measures, including network segmentation and enhanced access controls. Afterward, I conducted a second 24-hour observation to quantify the impact of the applied controls. The metrics below provide a detailed analysis of the captured security data throughout this assessment:
- SecurityEvent: Windows Event Logs
- Syslog: Linux Event Logs
- SecurityAlert: Log Analytics Alerts Triggered
- SecurityIncident: Incidents created by Sentinel
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL: Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

## Architecture Changes

### Before Hardening: 
The initial architecture was exposed and unsecured, with all resources publicly accessible over the internet. The Virtual Machines had their Network Security Groups (NSGs) and built-in firewalls configured with overly permissive rules, while other resources were deployed with public endpoints, completely bypassing the use of Private Endpoints. This configuration rendered the environment highly susceptible to external threats and attack vectors.
#### Vulnerabilities:
- Open ports facilitated unrestricted access to Virtual Machines, enabling potential exploitation.
- Publicly accessible resources (e.g., Azure Key Vault, Azure Blob Storage) left the environment vulnerable to external reconnaissance and exploitation.
#### Security Risks:
- The unprotected resources allowed attackers to conduct extensive scanning and exploit vulnerabilities, resulting in numerous failed authentication attempts and a surge in malicious traffic patterns.
### After Hardening:
A hardened architecture was implemented to mitigate the identified risks. Key changes included:
#### Architecture Security Enhancements:
- Deployment of Network Security Groups (NSGs) with granular, restrictive rules to limit inbound traffic to only authorized sources.
- Subnet segmentation to improve resource isolation and minimize lateral movement potential.
- Hardening of Virtual Machines by incorporating security controls such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), encryption at rest, and comprehensive access control lists (ACLs).
- Protection of Key Vault and Blob Storage through the use of Azure Firewall and Private Endpoints to restrict access to internal networks.
#### Security Improvements:
- The implementation of these security controls drastically reduced the attack surface. Only whitelisted traffic was permitted to access the resources, and continuous monitoring with advanced threat detection mechanisms was established to identify anomalous behavior and potential intrusions.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:

Start Time 2023-09-14T18:27:20

Stop Time 2023-09-15T18:27:20

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 111583
| Syslog                   | 9900
| SecurityAlert            | 204
| SecurityIncident         | 204
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 2612

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:

Start Time 2024-09-16T22:46:20

Stop Time	2024-09-17T22:46:20

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 20178
| Syslog                   | 32
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Key Observations:
- Windows Security Events: The analysis revealed a substantial reduction of 81.92% in security events recorded on Windows Virtual Machines following the hardening process. This notable decline underscores the effectiveness of the implemented security controls, such as firewalls and Network Security Group (NSG) rules, in mitigating unauthorized access attempts and reducing the attack surface.
- Linux Syslog Events: Similarly, the reduction in Syslog entries by 99.68% indicates that SSH brute-force attack vectors targeting Linux VMs were nearly eradicated after deploying security measures. Key enhancements included the restriction of open ports and the implementation of secure SSH configurations, effectively closing off avenues for exploitation.
- Security Alerts and Incidents: Both Security Alerts generated by Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Security Incidents recorded in Microsoft Sentinel dropped to zero. This stark decrease confirms the efficacy of the hardening techniques employed, which successfully blocked all potential attack attempts and eliminated the need for alert triggers. The complete absence of alerts and incidents is a strong indicator of a fortified security posture.
- NSG Inbound Malicious Flows: The complete elimination of malicious flows passing through the NSG, reflecting a 100% reduction, highlights the success of fine-tuning inbound traffic rules. By implementing strict filtering mechanisms, we effectively prevented unwanted and potentially harmful traffic from reaching the honeynet, thus reinforcing the environmentâ€™s defenses.
  
## Conclusion

This project illustrates the practical application of Azure services in establishing a Security Operations Center (SOC) and honeynet for comprehensive cybersecurity monitoring and threat analysis. The hardening process resulted in a significant enhancement of the overall security posture, rendering the environment more resilient to common attack vectors and potential threats.

The comparative analysis of pre- and post-hardening metrics distinctly highlights the effectiveness of the implemented security controls. Additionally, the generated attack maps and logs provide critical insights into global attack patterns, offering invaluable data for incident response teams to proactively mitigate emerging threats.

It is important to note that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that a greater number of security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls. This emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and adaptation of security measures to address evolving threats in a dynamic operational environment.
